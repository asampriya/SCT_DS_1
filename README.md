**Project Description:** 
Data Science Internship Task 1 at SkillCraft Technology

**Overview**
This repository documents my Data Science Internship project at SkillCraft Technology, where I tackled diverse tasks in data exploration, cleaning, and visualization using Python.

**Tasks Completed:**
Data Loading and Inspection: Loaded a population dataset, performed initial data exploration to understand its structure and contents.

**Data Cleaning:** 
Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized data types to prepare the dataset for analysis.

**Visualization:** 
Created histograms and bar charts using Matplotlib to visualize population distributions across multiple years and countries.

**Tools and Technologies Used:**
• Python 
• Pandas 
• Matplotlib

**Repository Structure:**
**• Notebooks:** 
Jupyter notebooks detailing each phase of the project.

**• Data:**
Contains the raw dataset and cleaned dataset files. 

**• Visualizations:** 
Includes images and plots generated during data visualization.

**How to Use:**
• Clone the repository and explore the Jupyter notebooks to understand the data exploration and visualization processes. 
• Experiment with the code to apply similar techniques to other datasets.

**Acknowledgments:**
Special thanks to SkillCraft Technology for providing this valuable learning opportunity and mentorship throughout the internship.
